The project utilizes a modern and robust tech stack to ensure high performance, scalability, and maintainability:

- **Frontend**: NextJS 15RC with App Router, React 19RC, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: MongoDB for flexible data storage, PayloadCMS 3.0 for content management, and Server Actions for efficient server-side operations.
- **State Management**: Zustand for simplified global state management.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI and Framer Motion for polished, animated user interfaces.
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with ZOD for robust form validation.
- **Additional Libraries**: Date FNS for date manipulation, Embla carousel for image galleries, and React Email for transactional emails.
- **Integrations**: Stripe for payments, API Unifi Access for facility access control.
- **Deployment**: Hetzner VPS running Coolify for streamlined deployment and management.

This comprehensive stack allows us to create a high-performance, secure, and feature-rich platform tailored to the town hall's specific needs.

The choice of modern web technologies for this project was crucial in achieving our goals of improved performance, enhanced user experience, and easier maintenance. Here's how key technologies contribute to the project's success:

1. **NextJS and React**: Provides a fast, SEO-friendly foundation with server-side rendering capabilities, crucial for a public-facing municipal website.

2. **PayloadCMS**: Offers a flexible, block-based content management system that allows non-technical staff to easily update and manage website content.

3. **TypeScript**: Enhances code quality and maintainability, reducing potential bugs and making future updates easier.

4. **TailwindCSS**: Enables rapid UI development with a consistent design language across the site.

5. **MongoDB**: Provides a flexible database solution that can easily adapt to changing data requirements.

6. **Stripe Integration**: Ensures secure and reliable payment processing for facility bookings and other potential future paid services.

7. **API Unifi Access**: Enables automated access control for sports facilities, improving user experience and reducing administrative overhead.

These technologies work together to create a platform that's not only modern and efficient but also scalable and future-proof, setting a new standard for municipal websites.
