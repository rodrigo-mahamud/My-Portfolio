  overview: As the VFX Supervisor and IT manager for the "Rewind Hispano" from 2020 to 2023, I had the privilege of leading the visual effects production and server infrastructure for this annual project. The "Rewind Hispano" celebrates the most significant moments, trends, and figures of the year within the Spanish-speaking digital creators’ community.<br><br> In the most recent edition, I faced the challenge of coordinating and supervising an international team of over 40 VFX specialists spread across more than eight countries, including Spain, Hungary, Mexico, Venezuela, El Salvador, Argentina, Bangladesh, India... This challenge required not only managing a diverse and geographically dispersed team but also implementing technical solutions to ensure effective and efficient remote collaboration.<br><br> My responsibilities were extensive and included team organization, resource allocation, post-production budget management, and negotiating with suppliers. In addition to these organizational tasks, I also took on the role of IT Manager, setting up the necessary server infrastructure to facilitate remote work. This goes from configuring servers with decentralized redundancy to implementing systems for secure and efficient large-scale file transfers, ensuring seamless operations across different geographic zones.

<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">The "Rewind Hispano" is a community project that brings together the Spanish-speaking digital content creator community to celebrate the year's highlights. Inspired by the concept of YouTube Rewind, this annual video features the trends, events, and personalities that set the agenda on the Spanish-speaking internet, but with a specific focus on the richness and diversity of the digital culture in Spanish. Unlike its global counterpart produced by YouTube, the Rewind Hispano is an initiative created by and for the Hispanic community, allowing for a more authentic and closer representation of its interests and achievements.</p>

<PostCards cards={frontmatter.cards} />

<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">The project aims not only to celebrate the successes and viral moments of the year but also to encourage collaboration among creators from various countries, creating a space for union and mutual recognition. It includes everything from sketches and references to popular memes to tributes to influential figures in the digital community who, through innovative visual effects and creative narratives, create a time capsule of the Hispanic digital culture of the year.</p>

<SinglePostHeader title={frontmatter.singlePostHeader2.title} preTitle={frontmatter.singlePostHeader2.preTitle} />

<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">For the 2023 edition, Alec and the team of scriptwriters set out to innovate by transforming the previous format, based on small sketches linked by transitions, into a more cohesive narrative structure with logical connections between all the scenes. To achieve this, we introduced a central character: R.O.B., an animated robot that embodies Artificial Intelligence, in charge of guiding the narration of the video.</p>

<div class='flex mt-16 mb-16'>
  <PostImage image={frontmatter.postImage} />
</div>

<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">This renewed approach brought several post-production challenges. Incorporating an animated robot into most scenes, along with the extensive visual effects (VFX) work characteristic of this project, significantly increased the number of shots requiring post-production. The post-production process began on October 1, 2023, providing us with 79 days to deliver the final product by December 18. During this time, post-production proceeded concurrently with the filming of new sequences, underscoring the necessity for efficient coordination across all teams. To ensure effective collaboration, we divided post-production into three primary groups, each consisting of specialized teams. These teams were given clear objectives, guidelines on the expected final outcome, and delivery deadlines. Within each group, members selected tasks in consultation with their colleagues, fostering a supportive work environment and ensuring the quality of the final product. Given the tight deadlines, we had to ensure accuracy on the first attempt, as there was no room for redoing parts or entire scenes.</p>

  <PostImage image={frontmatter.postImage2} />
</div>

<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">For example, for the initial scene running from minute <a class='underline underline-offset-2' href="https://youtu.be/TjkRhh3Gh1U?t=132"> 2:11 </a> to <a class='underline underline-offset-2' href="https://youtu.be/TjkRhh3Gh1U?t=212">3:31</a>, we began pre-editing as soon as the shots were received from the filming team on set. Alec then reviewed and refined this edit to achieve the final version we continued to work on. Subsequently, we convened the necessary teams for this sequence, which included specialists in 3D animation, 2D animation, composition, Houdini, and motion graphics.</p>

<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">At this meeting, the specific tasks of each team, the desired end result, the deadlines and the resources needed to carry them out were defined. Specifically, this scene required 3D tracking of the environment for the precise integration of the robot, as well as the removal of brands, logos and backgrounds. As these tasks are purely mechanical and do not directly enhance the final aesthetics, we outsourced them to specialized vendors, one vendor for 3D tracking, and another vendor for logo removal and background removal.</p>

</div>

<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">This way of organization and work was repeated with as many scenes as possible, thanks to this we were able to quickly scale and parallelize the post-production process, which ended up with **more than 40 people working at the same time in small parts of the project**, which allowed us to meet the deadline without any team member ending up overloaded with work. </p>

<SinglePostHeader title={frontmatter.singlePostHeader4.title} preTitle={frontmatter.singlePostHeader4.preTitle}/>
<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">This parallel workflow allowed us to progress at a great pace, meeting our deadline. However, **coordinating 40 people working remotely from around the globe, handling 6.7GB of video files per minute… posed significant challenges in terms of infrastructure**. Critical questions arose: How do we securely store the files? What's the best way to send them globally?  How do we manage access permissions?.  </p>
\
<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">I was tasked with designing and implementing a network infrastructure that could address these issues and adapt to the project's workflow. The final design was as follows: </p>

<p class="animate-on-scroll leading-7 text-base" data-type="simple"  data-duration="1.5" data-easing="Expo.easeOut">From a hardware standpoint, the network comprises two servers located in different places: a Synology DS1621+ and another server I assembled myself, running TrueNAS Scale. Opting for two distinct physical locations aimed to maximize protection against incidents like fires, collapses, or thefts. Each server features a set of disks in RAID 5, with 1TB read and write caches, and each is backed by an EATON 5SC 1500I UPS system. </p>
